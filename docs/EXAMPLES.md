# Examples

In general, examples can be found in `examples`. Many additional examples can be
found in the provided command line tools.

Examples:

* `examples/bash`: contains examples of using the command line tools corresponding
  to the individual superpixel algorithms; demonstrates the usage of:
    * `eval_boundaries2labels_cli`,
    * `eval_connected_relabel_cli`,
    * `eval_summary_cli`,
    * `eval_visualization_cli`.
* `examples/cpp` contains examples for using the tools provided in `lib_eval`;
  these include (multi-label) connected components, creating evaluation summaries
  based on superpixel segmentations available as CSV files, and visualizing superpixel
  segmentations available as CSV.
* `examples/matlab` contains examples of using the MatLab tools provided in `lib_tools`,
  including connected components and visualization.
